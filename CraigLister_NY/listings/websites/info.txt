Hello everyone,
my name is Steve and I am professional web and mobile developer looking for some side projects. I do not work equity, I only work for money, 50% wil have to be prepaid, but 50% of $99 is very cheap. I know HTML5+CSS3, WordPress and other website builders. Please find samples of my work attached and below.
